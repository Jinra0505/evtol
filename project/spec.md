# eVTOL + EV Logit-SUE Equilibrium (V1)

This project implements a multi-time, multi-VOT-group traffic equilibrium with EV and eVTOL alternatives, CBD MFD Scheme 2 coupling, station congestion, and a Logit-SUE fixed point. The V1 solver uses manual itineraries from the data and supports an optional energy-feasible itinerary generator interface for V1+.
